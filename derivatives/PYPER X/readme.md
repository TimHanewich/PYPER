## Setting up PIGPIO to run
First, run `pigpiod` daemeon:
```
sudo pigpiod
```

To ensure it is running:
```
ps aux | grep pigpio
```
You should see it running in there.

## Starting up PYPER X
- Plug in power. Allow it to boot.
- SSH into it.
- Run `pigpiod` daemeon: `sudo pigpiod`
- Confirm `pigpiod` daemeon is running: `psx aux | grep pigpio`
- Run `main.py` with **sudo permissions**: `sudo python main.py`
